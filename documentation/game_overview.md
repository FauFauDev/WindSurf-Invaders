It employs dirty rectangle optimization for improved performance and includes a comprehensive sound system with both sound effects and background music. Sound levels are carefully balanced for optimal gaming experience:
- Background music plays at moderate volume (50%)
- Frequent sounds like shooting are kept lower (40%)
- Important events like explosions and boss appearances are more prominent (60-70%)
- Warning sounds and level completion effects are clearly audible (60-70%)
